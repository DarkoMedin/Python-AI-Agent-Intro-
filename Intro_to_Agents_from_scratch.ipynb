            "Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated terrestrial ecosystems for over 160 million years, from the Triassic period (around 230 million years ago) until the end of the Cretaceous period (about 66 million years ago). Here’s a comprehensive overview:\n",
            "\n",
            "## **Key Characteristics**\n",
            "- **Upright posture**: Unlike other reptiles, dinosaurs had legs positioned directly beneath their bodies, making them efficient walkers and runners.\n",
            "- **Varied sizes**: Ranged from the chicken-sized *Compsognathus* to the massive 100-ton *Argentinosaurus*.\n",
            "- **Egg-laying**: All dinosaurs reproduced by laying eggs.\n",
            "\n",
            "## **Major Groups**\n",

            "\n",
            "**2. Saurischia (\"lizard-hipped\")**\n",
            "- Includes both carnivores and herbivores\n",
            "- **Theropods**: Mostly carnivorous, bipedal hunters like *Tyrannosaurus rex*, *Velociraptor*, and *Allosaurus*\n",
            "- **Sauropods**: Long-necked giants like *Brachiosaurus*, *Diplodocus*, and *Apatosaurus*\n",
            "\n",
            "## **The Extinction Event**\n",
            "Most dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, likely caused by a massive asteroid impact in present-day Mexico. This created a \"nuclear winter\" effect that devastated ecosystems. However...\n",

            "## **Dinosaurs Are Still Here!**\n",
            "**Birds are living dinosaurs**—direct descendants of small, feathered theropods. This makes them the only dinosaur lineage to survive extinction. Fossil evidence shows many non-bird dinosaurs had feathers too, including *T. rex* and velociraptors.\n",
            "\n",
            "## **Common Misconceptions**\n",
            "- **Not all prehistoric reptiles were dinosaurs**: Pterosaurs (flying reptiles), plesiosaurs (marine reptiles), and Dimetrodon (a synapsid) were not dinosaurs.\n",
            "- **They didn't all live together**: Dinosaurs spanned three periods; *Stegosaurus* and *T. rex* were separated by nearly 90 million years.\n",
            "- **Most were not giants**: Many were small to medium-sized.\n",
            "\n",
            "## **Fascinating Facts**\n",
            "- Some had complex social behaviors and parental care\n",
            "- Their fossils reveal evidence of cancers, injuries, and even combat\n",
            "- Dinosaur discoveries continue today, with about 50 new species named annually\n",
